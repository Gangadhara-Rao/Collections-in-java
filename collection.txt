Collections in Java:
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, 
LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

What is Collection framework:
The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It has:
Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
Algorithm

Iterator interface
Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.

Iterable Interface
The Iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes. The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface and therefore all the 
subclasses of Collection interface also implement the Iterable interface.

Collection Interface
The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework. 

List Interface
List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects.
It can have duplicate values.
List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList();  
List <data-type> list2 = new LinkedList();


ArrayList:
The ArrayList class implements the List interface. It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types. 

LinkedList:
LinkedList implements the Collection interface. It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements. It can store the duplicate elements.
